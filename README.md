UNHCR People of Concern in Neighboring Countries
================================================

This is a respository with the code used to create the indicator `Number of People of Concern in Neighboring Countries`. The list of neighboring countries was taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_land_and_maritime_borders).

The list was scraped using [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com)'s "Extract tables" tool.
